## Overview
My challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### What I learned

This is my first time dealing with APIs! ðŸŽ‰

```js
 var url = `https://api.adviceslip.com/advice`;
  
    fetch(url)
      .then(response => {
        return response.json();
      })
  
      .then(data => {
        /* created variables to store the data from the api */
        let slipId = data.slip.id;
        let slipAdvice = data.slip.advice;
  
        id.textContent = `Advice #${slipId}`;
        advice.textContent = `${slipAdvice}`;
      })
  
    //error text is thrown if the data fetched cannot be retrieved
    .catch(err => alert("Something not good happened"));
  };
```
